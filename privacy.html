  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: March 2025</p>

  <p>
    Sima Swipe Calculator is a lightweight calculator app designed for quick access through a floating overlay.
    Your privacy is important to us, and we want to make it clear that:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.</li>
    <li>No data is transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</li>
    <li>All calculations and app usage happen entirely on your device.</li>
    <li>The only permission required is <strong>“Appear on top”</strong>, which is strictly used to display the calculator overlay above other apps.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Because no data is collected, there is nothing to delete or manage — your activity stays private on your own device.
